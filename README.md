#  Express Demo

## Overview

This project serves as a basic demonstration and learning resource. For production-level applications, additional considerations such as security, error handling, scalability, and performance optimizations should be implemented.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Run the server using `npm start   npm install express mongoose 
`.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the demo page.

## Project Structure

- **`index.js`**: Entry point of the Express application.
- **`public`**: Directory containing static files like HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript.
- **`views`**: Directory for server-side views if used in the project.
- **`routes`**: Directory for organizing route handlers if the application grows.
- **`models`**: Directory for data modeling and interacting with the database. In this project, we demonstrate basic user data modeling with Mongoose.
- **`controllers`**: Directory for handling business logic related to different routes or entities.
